            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a strong passion for technology and data-driven problem-solving. My educational background in Electronics and Communication Engineering, coupled with my hands-on experience in programming languages such as Python and C++, has equipped me with a solid foundation in software development and data analysis.
                One of my key strengths is my ability to apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios. I have successfully contributed to projects in the fields of computer vision (OpenCV), natural language processing (NLP), and disease prediction (Parkinson's disease) during my internship at SHAPE AI. Additionally, my work on a classification model for micro-array data using feature engineering techniques showcases my dedication to solving complex data-related challenges.Through internships and projects, I have gained valuable experience in data analysis, machine learning, web development, and mobile app development. Notably, I completed internships at SHAPE AI and APSSDC, where I honed my skills in Machine Learning, Python, Data Visualization, SQL, and Android app development. My passion for technology extends to research, where I have contributed to projects such as text summarization of the CORD-19 dataset and neuron model latency estimation using the FNS simulator. I am a continuous learner, holding certifications from Coursera and HackerRank. My goal is to make a positive impact in the world of technology and engineering. In my research project, I'm using a computer simulator to understand how quickly neurons in the brain react to stimuli, akin to measuring reaction times. I create virtual brain-like scenarios, run simulations, and translate the results into visual data to gain insights into neural response times. This exploration has implications for improving brain-like computer models and enhancing our understanding of brain function, albeit with the challenge of handling complex simulations and large datasets. Ultimately, my aim is to shed light on the timing of neural responses, contributing to advancements in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
