The table allows users to select specific rows using checkboxes, making it easy to manage and interact with student records.
It combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly table.
Key features include checkbox selection, row expansion for additional details, and buttons for adding new students and submitting selected awards.
